## 🍭 Development

This project is self-managed. It means that we have some husky hooks defined in the package.json that does all the work for us. So you just need to write your ES6 code, then commit (which will lint the code, and maybe reject it if it has lint error) and push/publish (will compile the current code for commonjs/umd).

Anyway, for more productive coding sessions, you can use `yarn start` to watch for changes & obtain direct feedback/errors.

## 💸 Donations

I currently work on this project during my free-time, but also during my work-time. As I'm my own boss, I take work time to work on personnal projects that I really believes in. But during this time, I don't win any money. I'm not doing that for money.

Anyway, if you consider support me, you can pay me a pack of Monster's cans for moore productive coding, :D.

I accept donations in form of Monero, Bitcoin and Etherum. You can also Patreon me !
