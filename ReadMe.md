# ShatHui üí¨

Shathui stands for ¬´ Chat-UI ¬ª and is a React/React Native library aiming to provide components to develop a modern & beautiful IM application based on the Material Design guidelines.

Components are written in two flavors ; `component.js` for React & `component.{native|android|ios}.js` for React Native. This allows for the components to be used the same way on both frameworks, allowing truely single codebase.
